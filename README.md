## About

This project uses [Python3](https://www.python.org/) or [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

## Getting Started in 3 simple steps (Mac OS)

1. Install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/) and a [text editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) of your choice.
2. Clone your project in [Terminal](http://www.informit.com/blogs/blog.aspx?uk=The-10-Most-Important-Linux-Commands)

   ```
   git clone PROJECT_URL
   cd PROJECT_FOLDER/
   ```

3. Create and activate virtualenv

   ```
   python3 -m venv my-virtualenv
   source my-virtualenv/bin/activate
   ```


## Getting Started in 5 steps (Windows)

1. Install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and a [text editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) of your choice.
2. Add Python to [System Path](https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/)

   * Locate `Python3` from your local computer. Usually located in the following folder:

     ```

     ```
     C:\Users\your-name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32
     ```

   * Follow this [link](https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/) from step 2 to the end.
   * Go into Command Prompt by typing `cmd` in search bar, and type `python`. You should see the following:

     ```
     Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48ecebad5, Dec 18 2017, 21:07:28)

     Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
     >>>
     ```

   * Type `exit()` to exit the python shell.

3. Clone your project in [Command Prompt](http://www.informit.com/blogs/blog.aspx?uk=The-10-Most-Important-Linux-Commands)

   ```
   git clone PROJECT_URL
   cd PROJECT_FOLDER
